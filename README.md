WebDesktop OS GUI is the easy way to make desktop apps with web languages and nothing else!

Installing apps is as easy. All you need to do is unzip the app in this folder Documents/wdOS/App/

With WebDesktop you can broadcast a website or files on your local network or over the internet with router configurations. (You may need to play with firewall settings)

WebDesktop even comes with a very basic web browser.(not currently in mac addition)

To build an app:
* create a folder with your app title in this directory Documents/wdOS/App/
* add you code with entry point index.html
* add an icon with name ic.png
* add a file called wd.json with contents that look like this 
{"name": "Sample", "des": "This is a test project!"}
